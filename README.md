# 💡 Blink LED with Arduino

This is my first Arduino project using the built-in LED and external components.

---

## 🔧 What It Does
The LED blinks ON and OFF every second using pin 13 on the Arduino Uno.

---

## 🧰 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- 220Ω resistor
- Breadboard
- LED
- Jumper wires

## 💻 Code

See `blink.ino` for the full Arduino code.

---

## 🚀 What I Learned
- How to use `pinMode()` and `digitalWrite()`
- Basic Arduino setup and uploading
- Wiring an LED safely using a resistor

---

## 🎯 Next Step
Add a button to control the LED!
